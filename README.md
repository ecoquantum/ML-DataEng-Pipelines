# Machine Learning with Python

## How to Create Production-Quality Machine Learning Pipelines

- Develop Python code pipelines for data engineering and machine learning model training.
- Use existing powerful open-source packages, like scikit-learn, to write your own professional code for data engineering, transformation and pre-processing.
- Learn about the power of pipelines and why they are far superior to hard-coding values and procedures.
- Correctly and safely save your trained models for easy inclusion in your Python package for simpler and smoother testing, installation, deployment.
> Data in the real-world can be used to invoke machine learning (ML) models but there is work to be done on it. In fact, data presents a variety of characteristics that can even make it unsuitable for ML models. For example, data can contain missing values and some ML libraries cannot cope with that. Or data can be presented in strings, or categories, rather than numbers, and the computer can only perform computations with numbers. There are many examples of such challenges. Therefore, before training or invoking ML models, data manipulation and transformation is required. Pipelines can help. Pipelines assemble a set of steps that can be performed one after the other. Each step can take input and produce output, which can be the input to the next step. Using pipelines can help you streamline what can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Pipelines also help with existing libraries, and can enforce desired order of application steps, or create a convenient workflow for reproducibility of the work.

> With code pipelines, you can sequentially apply a list of transforms and build a final ML model. An ML pipeline improves the performance and organization of the entire model portfolio, getting models into production more quickly and making managing machine learning models easier.

## What you’ll learn and how you can apply it
### By the end of the live online course, you’ll understand:

- The difference between data engineering and ML code pipelines and code with hard-coded values and procedures.
- How to professionally write code pipelines for data engineering, pre-processing and machine learning model training.
- How to use many powerful open-source data engineering, transformation and manipulation packages in Python.
- How to professionally write your own data transformers (based on scikit-learn style).
- How to run pipelines to apply data manipulation and machine learning model training.
- Selecting and applying the correct transformations based on the type of your data.
- How to correctly and safely save and restore pipelines and models for future use.

### And you’ll be able to:

- Create professional code pipelines for machine learning tasks which will make other tasks such as model deployment and testing easier.
- Take advantage of existing open-source Python packages to automate machine learning tasks.
- Become proficient and comfortable with creating your own data transformers if need be. Here you will learn how to use object-oriented programming style and write code compatible with Python’s scikit-learn package.
- Apply multiple data transformation and pre-processing techniques to various types of variables such as continuous, categorical and temporal variables.
- Correctly and safely save and reload data transformers and machine learning models for future use.

## This live event is for you because…
- You are a data engineer or developer and would like to stand out from the crowd by learning how to write professional and production quality ML code.
- You are a data engineer or developer and want to learn how to correctly transform and pre-process various types of data such as continuous, categorical and temporal variables.
- You want to learn the daunting task of writing your own data transformers and processors that are suitable for use within pipelines.
- You are a data engineer or scientist and want to learn the essential skill of saving and loading models, data transformers, and entire pipelines, safely and correctly.
- You are a data engineer/scientist or developer and you would like to learn how to prepare your models for packaging and deployment by either writing your own code, or taking advantage of existing powerful freely-available libraries.
